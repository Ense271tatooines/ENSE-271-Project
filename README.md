## Project Background
The Regina chapter of the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC Regina) is committed to serving its members in their Communications career. It does this by effectively connecting members with opportunities to learn and grow. Be it through networking events, seminars or anything in that ballpark, there are many ways members are given access to means of excelling at their career. IABC Regina facilitates the advertising of communicator jobs. Both these tasks are in large part handled by their chapter website. The website in its current state is considered unsatisfactory from a user and administrative perspective. 
To begin:

- The website’s navigation is messy. 

- It is not as stylized as IABC Regina would like. 

- Website administration is also still needlessly complicated, and not designed in a way for non-tech oriented people to effectively use. 

- The website doesn’t take online payments, forcing IABC executive members to engage with the companies advertising transactions manually. 

- It is a pain to use on mobile devices

- Finally, the website is built upon Adobe’s Business Catalyst, which is being shut down. 

There is a great desire for the website to be refactored and improved.

## Business Opportunity
The IABC Regina chapter’s website is in need of improvement.  The ability for IABC Regina to communicate with its users is limited by a website which does not meet their wants or needs. A redesign of their front-end and back-end interfaces, would certainly improve the ability for all IABC Regina members to gain access to the opportunities IABC Regina offers. 

A redesign’s main goals would be to fix the pain points IABC's executive team has. Fix the navigation and make it pretty and functional, on both desktop and mobile. Simplify the website as much as possible, including automated administration wherever desired.

The mission statement of IABC Regina is: 

>“Our mission is to connect our members through learning, networking and mentoring opportunities, and to promote business communications standards.”

Anything from the website that actively hinders that mission statement should be removed or improved. Allowing IABC Regina to help others, and themselves, flourish.
