## Header

For the header I wanted to keep it simple, easily recognizable for those who commonly use the internet. 
I used a metaphor of a magnifying class to represent the search ability.

## General Page layout
On most of the pages the main text and body that the users are interested are enclosed in a card scheme. This helps to determine the gestalt principal of figure-ground.
The card 'pops' out easier when enclosed, making it seem like the cards are the foreground of the site. It also helps relate the information inside as being group together, furthering 
its relatedness.

## Images
Images are designed to always be near the thing they are related too. Users see things as close together as related, so the images should be related to the 
text they are in proxmity to. i.e gestalt proxmity

## Membership Benefits
On this page I use a vertical line to help create a continunity between the objects, even though they are offset. This helps to group together the ideas in a 
more clear fashion. gestalt continuinity

## Forms
Forms should be all in close proximity to ensure relatedness. The labels should highlight what each section of the affords the user.

## Navigation
The user is constrained to traverse the web in a specific order. That is, they can't go everywhere from the homepage. For example, the post job link is only
available after clicking the navbar Career headings. This will help to keep the user from being overwhelmed with navigation options.
